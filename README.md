# R Matrix Multiplication Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when performing matrix multiplication in R. The `bug.R` file contains code that attempts matrix multiplication but produces an incorrect result due to a subtle error in how matrix dimensions are handled.
The `bugSolution.R` file provides a corrected version of the code that addresses the error and produces the expected output.
This example highlights the importance of carefully checking matrix dimensions and understanding how R handles matrix operations to avoid unexpected results.
